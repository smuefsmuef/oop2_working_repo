## Create a private duplicate (Fork)
1. Fork this repo (top right next to star and watch)
2. Clone your fork `git clone <url>`
3. Add upstream remote to the original repo `git remote add upstream https://github.com/lunactic/oop2_working_repo.git`

## Keep your Fork synced to the orignal
1. Fetch updates from the original `git fetch upstream`
2. Check out your fork's local default branch `git checkout main`
3. Merge the changes from the upstream default branch - in this case, upstream/main - into your local default branch 
   `git merge upstream/main`
